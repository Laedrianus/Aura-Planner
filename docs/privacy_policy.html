        <p>
            <span class="highlight">All your data is stored locally on your device.</span> We use SQLite database and local file storage to ensure your information remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers unless you explicitly choose to export your data.

        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 AdMob (Google)</h3>
        <p>
            The free version of our App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain information as described in Google's Privacy Policy.

        <h3>5.2 Calendar Integration</h3>
        <p>
            When you export tasks to Google Calendar or other calendar services, you are subject to those services' privacy policies. We only open calendar URLs or provide ICS files; we do not access your calendar data.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Speech Recognition</h3>
        <p>
